# Introduction
I originally took this course in 2014 and received the __Distinction__ badge for completing these exercises (the badge no longer exists for this course).  I decided to go through all the material and do the programming exercises again when a friend wanted to take this course.  These are the optional programming exercises that I completed as a part of this class.  Upon doing the exercises again I used Python 3 (some code is known to be incompatible with Python 2).

**If you take this course you are encouraged to do the exercises yourself.  You will not learn as much if you just use my code.**

## About this Course
Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. In this course you will learn the inner workings of cryptographic systems and how to correctly use them in real-world applications. The course begins with a detailed discussion of how two parties who have a shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption.
